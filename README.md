#  12V AC to DC Converter â€“ KiCad Project

##  Project Description

This project involves the design and PCB layout of a **12V AC to DC Converter** using **KiCad**, a powerful open-source PCB design tool. The goal is to convert a 12V AC input into a smoothed DC voltage output suitable for powering basic electronic circuits.

The converter circuit uses a **full-wave bridge rectifier** made with four 1N4007 diodes, followed by a **filtering stage** using a 1000Î¼F capacitor to smooth the rectified voltage. An LED indicator is added to show power availability, along with supporting resistors for safety and functionality.

The entire circuit was **schematically designed**, **footprints assigned**, and a **PCB layout created** in KiCad. The design includes proper spacing, track width, and component alignment, along with a 3D preview to visualize the final product. This board is suitable for hobby projects, prototyping, and can be a base module in many embedded systems requiring DC power.

##  Step-by-Step Process in KiCad

### 1. **Schematic Design**
- Open **KiCad Eeschema** and create the circuit.
- Used components:
  - **4x Diodes (1N4007)** for full bridge rectification
  - **1x Capacitor (1000ÂµF)** for filtering
  - **2x Resistors (10kÎ© and 2.2kÎ©)** for biasing and current limiting
  - **1x LED** for power indication
  - **2x Screw Terminals (J2, J3)** for AC input and DC output

### 2. **Assign Footprints**
- Used the **Symbol to Footprint Assignment Tool**.
- Ensured all components had appropriate THT (Through Hole Technology) footprints.

### 3. **PCB Layout**
- Launched **PCB Editor**.
- Placed components compactly and logically.
- Routed tracks manually with 0.5mm width.
- Maintained clearances and avoided track overlap.
- Added labels like "AC in", "DC out", and "KiCad".

### 4. **3D Visualization**
- Used KiCadâ€™s **3D Viewer** to verify design before fabrication.
- Ensured component orientation and silkscreen alignment.

### 5. **Final Checks**
- Verified DRC (Design Rule Check) passed.
- Ensured no unconnected nets.
- Exported Gerber files if ready for manufacturing.
